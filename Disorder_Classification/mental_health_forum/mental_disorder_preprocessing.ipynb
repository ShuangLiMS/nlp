Delivered by Dr Oliver Howes of the Institute of Psychiatry  Psychology and Neuroscience  IoPPN  King 's College London   the title made reference to an early paper on the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia  where dopamine was referred to as  the wind of the psychotic fire .  An eloquent review of the dopamine hypothesis followed  from the perspective of studies employing positron emission tomography  PET  and magnetic resonance imaging  MRI  . Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter  playing a crucial role in brain processes such as how we predict events and experience rewards . Its over  abundance in the brain has long been posited as a theory for the symptoms of psychosis seen in people with schizophrenia . Brain imaging techniques such as PET  which uses a radioactively labelled tracer  can help us obtain information about all aspects of the dopamine system . We can specifically study dopamine receptors  dopamine synthesis  its transportation or its release from neurons  and these methods have allowed scientists to pinpoint abnormalities in schizophrenia . Using this technology  Dr. Howes and colleagues studied people with schizophrenia who had received very little treatment  and found that the abnormality of dopamine appears to be at the level of synthesis and release from brain cells  rather than at the receptor as was initially believed . But this  Dr. Howes went on to explain  does not tell us whether schizophrenia is caused by an abnormality in dopamine regulation  or whether increased dopamine is a result of having schizophrenia . Therefore  his group decided to conduct research studies with a group of people who were at high risk of developing schizophrenia but do not yet show symptoms adequate for a diagnosis . These people are said to be in the prodromal  or sub  clinical  phase of schizophrenia . Whilst many go on to develop further symptoms  some remain stable at the sub  clinical phase and are able to function perfectly well . A prominent historical example of such a person  Dr. Howes explains  was Joan of Arc . Despite hearing voices  which she attributed to angels   she was able to lead the French army to victory over the British . Thus  using the same PET imaging techniques  Dr Howes and his team found elevated dopamine synthesis in the striatum of people with sub  clinical symptoms  which appeared to be around halfway between controls and people diagnosed with schizophrenia . Further investigation found that this increase in dopamine was in fact specific to those who would go on to develop a full clinical syndrome of schizophrenia  while those with long term sub  clinical symptoms did not demonstrate any increase in dopamine synthesis .
